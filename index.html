            <p class = "content">Hi! I am Lane Xie, a junior in Computer Science at University of Wisconsin Madison</p>
            <p class = "content">I focus on software engineering and scalable systems. 
                During my internship at NARI Technology, I developed a microservice-based power monitoring application,
                 working closely with teams to ensure high
                 system performance using technologies like Spring Boot and Kafka.</p>
            <p class = "content">I also contribute to open-source projects, 
                particularly with CheckStyle, where I focus on improving code quality.
                 My involvement in the Software Development Club has enhanced my skills 
                 in backend development and teamwork, as we built a social media platform using a MERN stack.</p>
